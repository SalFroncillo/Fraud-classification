# A SCORE FOR FRAUD DETECTION LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING

With the increasing diffusion of digital currency, it is of fundamental importance to put in place mechanisms capable of combating fraud. Although banking institu- tions have teams of experts capable of evaluating the genuineness of a transaction, this is clearly a problem that requires the support of a specific IT infrastructure. In fact, although it is possible to accept or reject a transaction based on rules established manually by experts, systems of this type are not scalable when the complexity of the parameters to be considered increases significantly. In building an automated Fraud Detection system, Machine Learning can make a substantial contribution. Using these techniques, it is in fact possible to extract patterns char- acterizing fraudulent transactions from the data, even when they are so complex that they cannot be even identified by a team of experts. This information can then be exploited to classify future transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Over the years a variety of Machine Learning algorithms have been used to tackle the problem of Fraud Detection. The present work of thesis aims at using a combina- tion of three algorithms to develop a score for the classification of the risk of a transaction. The algorithms used are XGboost, Random Forest and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The score consists in a value ranging from 0 to 3, based on how many algorithms define the transaction as fraud.
